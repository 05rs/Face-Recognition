# Face-Recognition 

End to End Face-Recognition follows the approach described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) with modifications inspired by the OpenFace project. Keras is used for implementing the CNN, Dlib and OpenCV for aligning faces on input images. Semi-hard triplet loss and online semi-hard triplet generator are used for further fine-tuning.. Face recognition performance is evaluated on a small subset of the LFW dataset which you can replace with your own custom dataset e.g. with images of your family and friends if you want to further experiment with the notebook. 

## Technology Used

## `Preprocessing Pipeline`

  - Directory based image retrival
  
  - Face Extraction using `DLib` as per FaceNet paper and Face Alignment (eyes and mouth landmark based alignment)
  
## `Face Recognition Pipeline` 

  - Used pretrained 'nn4.small2.v1' model [[2]](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/models-and-accuracies/#model-definitions)
  
  - Creating `Siamese Net` adding a triplet loss layer.
  
  - Used Tensorflow `Semihardloss`
  
  - Uses custom semi-hard online triplet Generator for fine-tuning
  
    - Generate the best triplet in the given batch of training.
   
 
## `Evaluation Pipeline` 

  - Used Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (gnb) for inference.
  
    - Distance Threshold using `pretrained model` on subset of LFW Dataset.

  - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is applied to the 128-dimensional embedding vectors.
  
    - t-SNE of `pretrained model` on subset of LFW Dataset
